   <blockquote>MARCELLUS
    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,<br>
    And will not let belief take hold of him<br>
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:<br>
    Therefore I have entreated him along<br>
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;<br>
    That if again this apparition come,<br>
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.<br>
    - Hamlet </blockquote>
